= Architecture

== Docker

The docker architecture is composed of 4 containers :

* **backend :**  A GraphQl backend
* **frontend :**  A web application with react and an nginx server

== Container phylosophy

The `Dockerfile` just install the system dependencies, and then call the `entrypoint.sh` bash script.
The goal of this script is to **compile and run** the project of the container.

Moreover, all the code is mounted on containers with a volume (ie. it's not part of the `Dockerfile` with a _ADD_ or a _COPY_).
So all code modification are directly available in containers.

This is usefull for development, but also in production when you need to update the stack.
You just have to do a `git pull`, and then restart the stack, without to rebuild all the containers.

You just need to rebuild containers when there is a change on :

* a `Dockerfile`
* an `entrypoint.sh`

And normally, they are pretty stable.

== Docker compose phylosophy

There are 3 files :

* **.env :** it's the environment files with all the docker variables, like _ports_, _version_, _path_, _users_, ...
* **docker-compose.yml :** it's the main docker compose file, where all the stack is describe
* **docker-compose.override.yml :** this docker compose file override/enhance the previous one.

The override file contains only some port bindings.
This is really useful in development, because as a developer, I want to have a direct access to the stack tools.

But in production, to avoid security breach, I prefer to have only one port open on the stack,
and it's the one of the web application.

== Run the stack in dev mode

Just run `docker-compose up` inside the project `docker` folder.

NOTE: If you have many docker projects, I recommend you to use a prefix for the stack : `docker-compose -p archelec up`

== Run the stack in prod mode

* To enable the production mode, you need to change the configuration `MODE` to `prod`.
Don't edit the `.env` file to avoid conflict on code update. Instead you can either :

** (recommended) Override the `.env` variable by adding the variable into your `.bashrc` : `echo 'export MODE="prod"' >> ~/.bashrc`
** Or make a copy of the `.env` file (like `.env.prod`) and edit it. If you do so, you must run the docker-compose command with the flag `--env-file .env.prod`

* Run the command `docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up` (or `docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml --env-file .env.prod up`) inside the project `docker` folder.
